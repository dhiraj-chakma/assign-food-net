      <h1>My Recipe</h1>
      <p>
        Little is known about Monica Geller's addicting, social-norm-disrupting
        candy: it involves chocolate, it tastes like little drops of heaven,
        it's indescribable. Based off what I've observed in my frame-by-frame
        analysis, it appears to be chocolate-covered caramels, something I'm
        more than apt to make. But it involves tempering chocolate - will I
        survive? Yeah, probably - tempering chocolate sucks, but so long as you
        have a double boiler/an accurate thermometer/patience, anyone can do it!
